# Dynamic Memory Allocation - Employee ID Storage

This repository contains a C program that showcases the application of dynamic memory allocation. The program dynamically allocates memory for storing employee IDs of a given length and displays the IDs.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/SinghIsWriting/Employee-Management-System.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.
3. Compile the C program using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:
gcc main.c -o employee_id_storage

4. Run the compiled program:
./employee_id_storage

5. The program will prompt you to enter the length of the employee ID.

6. Enter the desired length for the employee ID.

7. The program will dynamically allocate memory for the employee ID based on the given length.

8. Enter the employee ID when prompted by the program.

9. Repeat the process to store more employee IDs if desired.

10. The program will display all the entered employee IDs.

## Program Details

The `main.c` file contains a program that demonstrates the application of dynamic memory allocation. The program allows the user to input the length of the employee ID and dynamically allocates memory for storing the ID.

The program utilizes a for loop to iterate through the length of the employee ID and dynamically allocate memory accordingly. It then prompts the user to enter the employee ID, which is stored in the allocated memory.

Finally, the program displays the stored employee IDs on the console.

This program serves as an example of how dynamic memory allocation can be used to manage and store data of variable length.

Feel free to explore the code in the repository and modify it according to your needs.

Happy coding!
